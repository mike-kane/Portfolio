# Curriculum I Wrote

Some of the best examples of my abilities as a Data Scientist can be seen in the curriculum I've written explaining various models. All curriculum for the Flatiron School is open-source and publicly available on github.  

I've selected the following repos as good examples of my work. Please follow the links to check them out!

### NOTE

**_To see the code I've written in each of these repos, please look at the solution branch, not the master branch!_**

## 1. [Herd Immunity Simulation](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-1-07-12-building-an-object-oriented-simulation-lab)

In this lab, I walk students through designing and building a program that demonstrates the concept of [Herd Immunity](https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/work/protection/index.html) by creating a simulation. The goal of this project is to give students deliberate practice with everything they've learned regarding Object-Oriented Programming.

## 2. [Market Segmentation With Clustering](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-3-35-09-market-segmentation-with-clustering-lab)

In this lab, I demonstrate how we can use unsupervised learning algorithms such as PCA, K-Means Clustering, and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering to perform segmentation on market data. The dataset used in this lab is the [Wholesale Customers Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wholesale+customers), which is hosted by the UCI ML Datasets website.

## 3. [XGBoost](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-3-32-11-xgboost-lab)

In this lab, I demonstrate how to make use of the python API for XGBoost, the current best-in-class package for Gradient Boosted Tree models. XGBoost makes use of many under-the-hood optimizations that make it parallelizable and compatible with GPU-based training, which makes it a much more performant choice than the basic implementation found in sklearn. In this lab, I also have students perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.

## 4.  [Context-Free Grammars](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-4-37-08-context-free-grammars-codealong)

In this lab, I have students build a small Context-Free Grammar and visualize the resulting parse trees for an example sentence. I also demonstrate how we can use NLTK to get Part-Of-Speech tags for text data.  

## 5. [Bidirectional Sequence Models](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-04-46-07-bidirectional-sequence-models-lab)

In this lab, I demonstrate how to use a Bidirectional LSTM model for toxic comment classification. This challenge and dataset comes from the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) posted by Google and Jigsaw

## 6. [Text Classification With Word Embeddings](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-04-45-06-classification-with-word-embeddings-lab)

In this lab, I demonstrate how we can use mean word embedding vectorization to  allow us to format arbitrarily long chunks of text to format the data for classification. This lab also demonstrates the use of Embedding Layers with Deep Neural Networks.

## 7. [LSTMs and GRUs](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-04-46-05-LSTMs-and-GRUs-lab/tree/solution)

This lab demonstrates how to build sequence models that make use of LSTM and GRU cells. In this particular case, we use LSTMs and GRUs for classification on the Newsgroups dataset found in sklearn.
