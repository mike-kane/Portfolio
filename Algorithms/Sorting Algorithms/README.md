## Selection Sort
Time Complexity: O(n**2)      
Space Complexity: O(1)

*Description:*
Selection Sort works by 'selecting' the largest element in the list and moving it to the end of the list--in a list of length n, the index would be n-1.  Next, it iterates through the list and selects the second largest element in the list, and places it at index (n-2). This process is repeated until the list is fully sorted.  

Since the sort can be done in-place, the space complexity of Selection Sort is O(1).  The space complexity is bounded at O(n**2).  This is because Selection Sort contains an outer loop (starting at the end of the list and iterating backwards) and an inner loop (iterating from the start of the list up to the current position of the outer loop).  

It is worth noting that as selection sort progresses, the range of the inner loop gets smaller and smaller.  This means that the time complexity of selection sort is actually better than O(n**2), although according to the rules of Big O, we ignore this and still classify the time complexity of this sort as 0(n**2).
