# My Portfolio

I've created this repo as a centralized source for the projects and work that showcase my knowledge and skillset.

## Who I am
I'm a Senior Data Scientist currently looking for new opportunities.

## Work Experience

**_NLP Consulting - 01/2020 - Current_**

Currently, I consult for [Scaia](https://scaia.ai/), a deep NLP/NLU startup focused on using AI to improve the E-Discovery process for law firms. My responsibilities include business strategy, fundraising, model architecture, and playing a key role in building out the company's MVP. I have 6+ years experience with Python, 4 years experience with Machine Learning, 3 years experience with Deep Learning, and excel at communicating technical concepts to nontechnical stakeholders.  Working with Scaia is giving me a ton of hands-on experience with the awesome [HuggingFace Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). We're building the product on top of AWS.

**_Senior Data Scientist - 03/2018 - 01/2020 @ Flatiron School_**

From 2018 - January 2020,I was a Senior Data Scientist at The [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/). For last year, I was in charge of design and delivery for all [Enterprise training programs](https://flatironschool.com/enterprise). I lead a cross-functional team of Data Scientists, Engineers, Marketers, and Instructors, and was responsible for all pre-sales and technical solution design for clients. My approach to dealing with clients included collaborating with the client to deeply understand their needs, and then building and designing a functional MVP. From there, once we were all clear on the "goal line", I designed custom curriculum and training plans to upskill client teams so that they could build, maintain, and extend functionality of the MVP. We also helped clients screen appropriate candidates for trainings, build measurement plans and create performance goals for trained employees for after the course, and created customized "stay sharp" exercises and private Kaggle competitions to ensure participants' new skills don't go stale. Before I took the Enterprise role, I was 1 of 2 Senior Data Scientists that founded the curriculum team. I helped build out the entire team of data scientist and curriculum writers that created our full 15-week Data Science bootcamp. On this team, I was the subject-matter expert for Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

A few highlights:

* Managed cross-functional team of 4 - 6 data scientists, engineers, and marketers. I reported directly to the VP of Enterprise.
* When I joined, the team had $30k in revenue, and an average program NPS of -20. My last quarter, I personally closed $500k of pilot programs, with an average NPS of > 70 and more than $1 million in commitments for the next year.
* I built and managed a comprehensive, 3-week onboarding training for Data Science hires at one of the largest banks in England.
* I trained the Fraud team at one of largest accounting firms in the world and helped them bring Deep Learning into their workflow.
* I sold, designed, and managed a 5-week reskilling program for one of the largest Oil & Gas companies in the world.
* Average NPS for trainings I personally delivered was 90.

**_Curriculum Engineer - 03/2016 - 03/2018 @ Make School_**

Before I joined the Flatiron School, I was a technical curriculum engineer and instructor at Make School. I helped build out the Data Science track, and part of the Computer Science fundamentals curriculum. The courses I wrote are now being taught for college credit, and I played an integral role in helping Make School become a Nationally and Regionally accredited degree-granting institution.

**_High School Teacher/Wrestling Coach - 2011 - 2015_**

In my first career, I coached wrestling and taught English Literature and Computer Science at the high school level in Florida.

## Education, Skills, and Certifications

I have a Master's Degree in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University. I also have AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, and have completed several specializations on Coursera--see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikekane2/) for a full list.  

Here are my skills, at a glance:

* Strong leadership and communication skills (can't have one without the other!)
* SQL and NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Hadoop, Spark, DynamoDB)
* Python & Python DS ecosystem (numpy/pandas/scipy/matplotlib)
* Supervised and Unsupervised Learning with scikit-learn
* Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
* AWS and Azure platforms (learning GCP next!)
* Bayesian Inference
* A/B testing
* Time Series Forecasting
* Swift & iOS app development

## Goals and Interests

 I'm excited and passionate about all things Data Science--especially Machine/Deep Learning, NLP, and exciting new ways to productionize and serve ML models in the cloud (serverless is awesome)! Here are some of the things I'm currently working on learning:

 * AWS Machine Learning Practitioner specialization
 * Research - Sentence & Paragraph Level embeddings with Transformer models
 * Question Answering systems
 * Abstractive/Hybrid Text Summarization Models
 * Reinforcement Learning (Future DeepRacer Champion!)
