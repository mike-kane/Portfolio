# My Portfolio

## Who I am
I'm a developer and junior data scientist based in San Francisco, CA.  I specialize in Python and Swift.  I Geek out over all the unique and exciting applications of machine learning and data science.  I spend most of my spare time reading, building things in Keras/Tensorflow, and hanging out with my puppies, Jack and Alex.  

## My Story
My name is Mike Kane.  I'm a former High School English teacher and wrestling coach turned programmer.
I started learning to code because a few of my students were interested, and I wanted to help them learn how to code.
As a side effect, I was hooked.  I spent a few years learning as much as I could from websites like Codecademy and Edx as a hobbyist.  After our school ran into an urgent scheduling problem because of a nasty bug in some software, I volunteered to take a crack at it. As luck would have it, my solution worked, and my school asked me to develop and teach the school's first computer science course.  

After a year of buckling down and teaching an introductory course in python, I realized how much I had left to learn.  As luck would have it, Apple also released Swift 1 during the school year, so I began learning iOS development in my spare time.   I was hooked.  I applied Make School's Product Academy--an in-depth 2-year program of study that covers in-depth CS theory, software engineering, product development, and entrepreneurship. Against all odds, I was accepted, and the rest is history.

I now work for Make School as an instructor and technical curriculum designer.  Currently, I'm part of a two-person team responsible for designing, building out, and teaching our new Data Science electives.  I spend the majority of my working hours writing tutorials and jupyter notebooks about topics such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks. I'm also the principal curriculum designer and Education Lead on Make School's Swift CSP initiative.  Swift CSP is a free curriculum set aligned with College Board's new AP Computer Science Principles course, taught purely in Swift!  Students learn to the fundamentals of coding while completing projects that help them learn the finer points of designing, coding, and launching their own apps and games for iOS devices.

## Education

I'm currently pursuing a MS in Applied Data Science through Syracuse University, and loving every minute of it.
