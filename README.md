# My Portfolio

I've created this repo as a centralized source for the projects and work that showcase my knowledge and skillset.

## Who I am
I'm a Data Scientist that is currently employed writing curriculum for the Flatiron School's Data Science program. I also handle various Data Science-y tasks, such as designing data pipelines and training models to predict student performance, or giving seminars on advanced topics such as Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I currently live outside Oakland, CA with my fiancee and two very big, very energetic dogs. I spend my free time volunteering as a high school wrestling coach, and generally nerding out with other AI-focused friends over the cool new papers that seem to hit ArXiv each week.

## Work Experience

I've been working as a Data Scientist for the Flatiron School for just about a year now, and I'm one of the senior team members on the Curriculum Team. Before I joined the Flatiron School, I was employed by Make School, a small technical college/startup based in San Francisco. In my 2.5 years at Make School, I spent my time building our their Data Science and Machine Learning track, as well as teaching those courses directly. I also wrote and taught some of their foundational Computer Science courses, and created a fully compliant AP Computer Science Principles curriculum based on iOS app development that we gave away to teachers for free, with training and resources included. Before joining Make School in 2015, I taught AP Literature and Introductory Programming in Python at a high school in Ocala, FL for 5 years. I was also the head wrestling coach for the school, and ran the city's youth wrestling program.

## Education

I'm currently finishing up my final semester for an M.S. in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University. I'm on track to graduate with a GPA of 3.861. During my graduate studies, I've focused heavily on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, as well as more specialized topics such as NLP and Data Visualization.

## Goals and Interests

My primary focus right now is to continue to grow my skillset as a Machine Learning Engineer. I'm especially interested in GANs and NLP/NLU approaches with Deep Learning. Some of my personal projects include building a Raspberry Pi-powered smart mirror that uses facial recognition to personalize the display according to the preferences of the viewer. I'm also experimenting heavily with models such as [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html),  as pretraining and semi-supervised learning approaches seem to have strong immediate uses for NLP in industry settings.  

While I'm happy in my current role, but open to consulting offers, and I'm always open to hearing about what else is out there. To contact me, please use my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikekane2/).
