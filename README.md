# My Portfolio

## Who I am
I'm a Developer currently based in San Francisco, CA.  I specialize in Python and Swift.  My current goal is to earn acceptance into a Master's in Data Science (MIDS) program and become a Data Scientist.  I Geek out over all the unique and exciting applications of machine learning and data science.  I spend most of my spare time reading, coding, and hanging out with my puppy, Jack.  

## Who I Am
My name is Mike Kane.  I'm a former High School English teacher and wrestling coach turned programmer.
I started learning to code because a few of my students were interested, and I wanted to help them learn how to code.
As a side effect, I was hooked.  I spent a few years learning as much as I could from websites like Codecademy and Edx as a hobbyist.  After our school ran into a nasty bug in some scheduling software, I volunteered to take a crack at it. As luck would have it, my solution worked, and my school asked me to develop and teach the school's first computer science course.  

After a year of buckling down and teaching an introductory course in python, I realized just how much I had left to learn.  As luck would have it, Apple also released Swift 1 during the school year, so I began learning iOS development in my spare time.   I was hooked.  I applied Make School's Product Academy--an in-depth 2-year program of study that covers in-depth CS theory, software engineering, product development, and entrepreneurship. Against all odds, I was accepted, and the rest is history.

I now work for Make School as a curriculum engineer and Education Lead on their Swift CSP initiative.  Swift CSP is a
free curriculum set aligned with College Board's new AP Computer Science Principles course, taught purely in Swift!  Students learn to the fundamentals of coding while completing projects that help them learn the finer points of designing, coding, and launching their very own apps and games for iOS devices.
