# Data Structures

This folder contains example code for common data structures, as well as tests for each to make sure they work!  I've also thrown in some lesser known data structures that I find interesting (looking at you, Bloom Filter!).

## Trees
Good ol' trees.  

## Linked List
Singly/Doubly linked, as well as Stacks and Queues.
